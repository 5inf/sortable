JavaScript client-side sortable tables

See http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/ for details and FAQ.

Running the tests:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer (or stick the folder on a server somewhere)
open tests/core/TestRunner.html
Note that some tests fail precisely because sorttable doesn't handle those things yet.
